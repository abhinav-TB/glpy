## glpy

glpy is pyOpenGl wrapper which lets you work with pyOpenGl easily.It is not meant to be a replacement for pyOpenGl but runs on top of pyOpenGl to avoid most of the boiler plate setup

## Features

 - Robust abstraction over pyOpenGl event loop
 - decorators to simplify callback functions

## Code Example

 
    from  glpy  import *
    app = glpy()
    
    @point(10)
    def plotpoints():
	    glColor3f(100, 150, 200)
	    glVertex2f(0,0)
	    
    app.run(lambda:plotpoints())

   position | tuple    | Window position            | (0,0)
   bgcolor  | tuple    | background color           | (0, 0, 0, 1.0)
   title    | string   | window title               | new title

## How to use?

 - Make sure you have opengl installed on your system
 - Install the package using  pip.
 - import the package and initialilze glpy
 
   `app = glpy()`
 - you can pass in additional parameters as seen in the API Reference as keyword arguments

   ``` app = glpy(title = "line drawing")```
  - define your callback function with the help of point decorator which takes the size of the     point to be plotted as an argument . NOTE: using a decorator is not neccesory for the library to work but it can significatly reduce the code size
	``` 
    @point(10)
    def plotpoints():
	    glColor3f(100, 468, 200)
	    glVertex2f(0,0)
	```
- call the run the method using the callback function as  an argument to run the function
NOTE: use a lambda function to pass callback functions with arguments

    ``` app.run(lambda:plotpoints())```
